<h1> Introduction </h1>

Ally Kudos is an intracompany web application for peer-to-peer recognition. It offers a user-friendly, efficient way to connect with coworkers.
When people feel supported and seen, their attitude and thus productivity improve. Ally Kudos was created to enforce such goals.

Users log in to the web application to send a new kudos message to another coworker.
They can also view their dashboard, kudos statistics, and interaction awards.
Ally Kudos also offers an extra statistics page for administrators and managers to view employee connection across the company.
